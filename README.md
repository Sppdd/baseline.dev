# Baseline.dev

## üìã Overview


This repository contains **complete planning and implementation documentation** for building a VS Code extension that serves as an AI code assistant specialized in web platform features and browser compatibility.

**Project Goal:** Create an MVP VS Code extension that helps developers discover, adopt, and refactor code using the latest web platform features, powered by the official **Baseline** data from the Web Platform Dashboard.

---

## üéØ What Makes This Different?

Unlike general-purpose AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), this extension:

1. **Understands Web Platform Timeline** - Knows when features became "Baseline" (widely available)
2. **Browser-Focused Intelligence** - Specializes in compatibility and modernization
3. **Official Data Source** - Uses `web-features` npm package with authoritative data
4. **Multi-Model Support** - Users choose: Claude, Gemini, or Ollama local models
5. **Proactive Modernization** - Suggests upgrading legacy patterns to modern equivalents

### The Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

> **"The only AI code assistant that understands the web platform timeline"**

3. Say: "Build this VS Code extension following these specifications"
4. Claude will generate all the code files

### Option 3: Phased Approach

**Week 1:** Foundation
```bash
# Start with basic extension structure
# Integrate web-features package
# Connect to one AI model (Claude)
```

**Week 2:** Chat Interface
```bash
# Build webview panel
# Implement message handling
# Test end-to-end conversation
```

**Week 3:** Feature Discovery
```bash
# Add "Discover Features" command
# Query Baseline data
# Generate reports
```

**Week 4:** Polish & Launch
```bash
# Add remaining AI models
# Documentation
# Testing
# Package for distribution
```

## üìä Project Timeline

### MVP Development: 4 Weeks

| Week | Focus Area | Deliverables |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Extension scaffold, web-features integration, Claude provider |
| 2 | Chat UI | Webview panel, message handling, prompt builder |
| 3 | Features | Discovery command, refactoring engine, Baseline queries |
| 4 | Polish | Gemini/Ollama support, docs, testing, packaging |

**Total Estimated Time:** 80-100 hours of development

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:

‚úÖ Extension installs and activates in VS Code  
‚úÖ Chat panel opens and responds intelligently  
‚úÖ Users can switch between AI models  
‚úÖ "Discover Features" generates useful reports  
‚úÖ Baseline data loads and queries correctly  
‚úÖ Basic refactoring suggestions work  
‚úÖ Configuration UI is functional  
‚úÖ Documentation is complete

## üîê Security Considerations

- API keys stored in VS Code secret storage (not plain text)
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Rate limiting for AI API calls
- No sensitive data logged
- Privacy policy documented

## üéì Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Discovering Container Queries
```
Developer: Opens CSS file with media queries
Command: "WebFeature AI: Discover New Features"
Extension: Detects Container Queries are now Baseline
AI: Suggests replacing media queries with container queries
Result: Modern, more maintainable CSS
```

### Use Case 2: Modernizing Polyfills
```
Developer: Selects fetch polyfill code
Command: "Refactor for Modern Browsers"
Extension: Checks fetch Baseline status (high since 2017)
AI: Suggests removing polyfill, using native fetch
Result: Smaller bundle, native performance
```

### Use Case 3: Feature Exploration
```
Developer: Opens chat panel
Question: "Can I use View Transitions API?"
Extension: Queries web-features database
AI: Responds with:
  - Baseline status: Limited (2024-03)
  - Browser support: Chrome 111+, Edge 111+
  - Code example with fallback
Result: Informed decision with implementation guide
```
